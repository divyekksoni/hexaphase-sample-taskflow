# AI Instructions

> This project follows the **Hexaphase SDLC Framework** (by Divyek Soni).
> Any AI assistant working on this project MUST read this file first and follow it.

## 1. Project Overview  *(the human fills this in)*

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Project name | TaskFlow |
| One-line goal | A task-management REST API for small teams, with email reminders. |
| Target users | Small teams (2–20 people) who need a simple shared task list |
| Tech stack | *(decided in 2-Analysis; leave blank until then)* |
| Hexaphase mode | Standard |
| Project Owner | Divyek Soni |
| Repository | https://github.com/divyekksoni/hexaphase-sample-taskflow |

## 2. Session Start (do this every time)

1. Read this file completely.
2. Read `project-health.md` and identify the **current phase**, the **last Session Log entry**, and any **open blockers**.
3. Read the `README.md` of the current phase folder, plus any documents in it.
4. Reply with a short summary: *current phase, what was done last, what you propose to do next.*
5. Wait for the human to confirm before making large changes.

## 3. Session End (do this every time)

Before finishing, add a new entry at the **top** of the Session Log in `project-health.md`:
- the date
- what changed (files created or modified)
- what is next
- open questions for the human

Also update the phase checklist and status if anything moved.

## 4. Where Things Belong

| Content | Location |
|---|---|
| Vision, requirements, scope, roadmap | `1-Planning/` |
| Feasibility, tech options, risks, research | `2-Analysis/` |
| Architecture, data model, API, UI, ADRs | `3-Design/` |
| **All application source code** | `4-Coding/` |
| The primary, launchable application | `4-Coding/main-app/` |
| Supporting apps (admin, worker, API, shared libs) | `4-Coding/<app-name>/`, each with its own README |
| Test plans, test cases, bug log, reports | `5-Testing/` |
| Automated test code | Next to the code it tests, inside `4-Coding/` |
| Deployment guides, environments, releases, runbooks | `6-Deployment/` |
| Project status, decisions, session history | `project-health.md` |

Never put source code outside `4-Coding/`. Never put planning or design documents inside `4-Coding/` (except app READMEs).

## 5. Rules for the AI

1. **Respect the phase.** Work on the current phase. If you need to change an earlier phase (for example, a requirement turns out to be wrong), say so, update that document, and log it in the Decisions Log.
2. **Don't skip gates.** Don't start coding before the Design gate is approved, unless the human explicitly says to (for example, for a prototype or spike). Log that exception.
3. **Ask, don't assume.** If a requirement is ambiguous, ask one clear question rather than guessing.
4. **Trace everything.** Reference requirement IDs (for example, `US-03`) in designs, code commits and test cases.
5. **Design first, then code.** If code must differ from `3-Design/`, update the design or add an ADR first.
6. **Small, reviewable changes.** Prefer several small changes over one huge one.
7. **No secrets.** Never write keys, passwords or tokens into any file. Use environment variables.
8. **No destructive actions without approval.** Don't delete data or files, force-push, or drop databases unless the human approves.
9. **Keep health honest.** Report problems, failing tests and risks in `project-health.md`. Don't hide them.
